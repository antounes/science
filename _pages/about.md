I’m a research data scientist navigating the field of what’s for show called AI. In fact, I’m keen on probability theory, linear algebra, machine learning and deep learning. 
I love approaching problems in a rigorously scientific manner, finding beautiful solutions and explaining them well. This blog is my workbook, it's been continuously updated since December 2021 so as to keep a track of my research progress.

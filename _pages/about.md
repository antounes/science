I'm a research-minded data scientist. My current research interests focus on time series understanding and their approach with techniques expanding from fundamental statistics to machine learning. More broadly, Iâ€™m keen on probability theory, linear algebra, and machine learning. I love approaching problems in a rigorously scientific manner, finding beautiful solutions and explaining them well.

This blog is my workbook, it's been continuously updated since December 2021 so as to keep a track of my research progress.
